 - 2002/01/20 FIXED  replaced old style control macros with HAM_ macros in   mygba_sys.c

 - 2002/01/20 FIXED  MULTIBOOT define now has a value, for C++ compatibility

 - 2002/01/27 ADDED  HAMlib coding, and subsequent removal of old sys structs,   has begun. 
                     Flexible Text output improvements are the first main goal for HAMlib.

 - 2002/01/27 ADDED  TOOL_DMA defines added to make it easier using DMA in HAM   you should use this 
                     for simplicity. Please read the comments.

 - 2002/01/27 ADDED  M_DMAXCNT_TRANSFER_SET(mode) added to all DMA channels

 - 2002/01/28 ADDED  added excellent ASSERT macro, based on SGADE's

 - 2002/01/28 ADDED  added a few new useful memory access defines suchas    MEM_PAL_BG_16(x)

 - 2002/01/28 ADDED  added a selectable extension for the rom image name to   master.mak ... now 
                     defaults to .gba, which is more common.

 - 2002/01/30 ADDED  Added a BG memory manager

 - 2002/01/30 ADDED  Added a BG Tile allocation manager

 - 2002/01/30 ADDED  Added a BG Map Allocation manager

 - 2002/01/30 ADDED  Changes the bg_info structure to better integrate with   the new allocation managers.

 - 2002/02/02 ADDED  Added debugger support for BG Mem Allocation manager,   you can now get an 
                     Overview of Allocated blocks

 - 2002/02/02 FIXED  Moved the debugger into HAMlib

 - 2002/02/02 FIXED  Moved the old mygba_sys tools into HAMlib

 - 2002/02/02 ADDED  Useful DEFINE to get the memory adress of a HAM BG block   Essentially the same 
                     macro as getting the SBB

 - 2002/02/02 ADDED  Major objective reached: Brought down the .o's needed to   compile a HAM prog 
                     to crt0,main and HAMlib, no more mygba_sys mess.

 - 2002/02/04 ADDED  Added a PutTile function that will, depending on the bg struct   it is run on, 
                     detect the relative position of the tileset to the CBB, and calc the correct 
                     tilenumber for you!

 - 2002/02/04 FIXED  All major issues with the VRAM memory manager have been solved,   i think. It works great here.

 - 2002/02/05 FIXED  The ham_PutTile routine now works in all bgmodes and all bg types.   this means, 
                     whether you are putting tiles on a rot bg in mode1   ort a text bg in mode 0, the 
                     routine will sort out the placement   and data format.

 - 2002/02/05 FIXED  Due to the last mentioned fix the ham text display system now works on all BGs in 
                     all tile BG modes

 - 2002/02/05 ADDED  Added a few asserts checking if your program makes sense into the tile functions. 
                     You ll get shouted at by HAM if you mess up ;)

 - 2002/02/05 FIXED  Changed all BG rotation macros to just accept a value, the idea   of converting 
                     floats in the macro proved too slow and inflexible.

 - 2002/02/05 ADDED  Added some more attributes to the bg_info structure for scrolling.

 - 2002/02/05 ADDED  A whole range of new rotation macros R_BGXROT*. Added for HAMlib.

 - 2002/02/06 ADDED  The ham_BgInit function now checks if the structure was set up   correctly 
                     (map and tileset must be attached to bg struct)

 - 2002/02/06 FIXED  added stdarg.h and stdlib.h to mygba.h, as they are required by   HAMlib and 
                     generally it makes sense for them to be there.

 - 2002/02/06 FIXED  HAMlib now compiles with 0 warnings :)

 - 2002/02/09 ADDED  added new makefile targets to all samples called "send" and "vba"   now just type 
                     "nmake vba" and immediately see the results in the emu.

 - 2002/02/09 ADDED  added VBA SDL 0.8 to the HAM distribution. thanks for permission   to the author, Forgotten! 

 - 2002/02/09 ADDED  HAMlib BG functionality complete for initial v2 release.

 - 2002/02/09 ADDED  Several page layout fixes to dbg_Show machine monitor. Included   tracking of HAM OBJ 
                     manager data.

 - 2002/02/10 FIXED  Fixed bad bug in F_DISPCNT_BGMODE_GET

 - 2002/02/10 ADDED  Support for all map sizes

 - 2002/02/10 ADDED  Full blown hamlib sprite manager (!). Works in all BGModes. Sprite   
                     cloning now also works.

 - 2002/02/10 FIXED  tons of little bugs in mygba.h, again.

 - 2002/02/12 FIXED  last relative paths removed from makefile's. when HAMDIR is set,   
                     you should be able to compile whereever.

 - 2002/02/13 ADDED  Added installer support for the current HAMv2 including the   
                     startup scripts. Beta is near.

 - 2002/02/15 FIXED  Fixed a nasty memory deallocation bug in the obj ram manager. Now   
                     uses reference counting for obj vram blocks, much safer. Overhead   
                     is 1024byte more from now on.

 - 2002/02/15 FIXED  Another nasty one fixed: Whenever you used ASSERT (even if it did
                     not fire off) your Interrupts were turned off :) fixed.

 

 -  2002/02/18 -----  Released HAM v2 (and followup sr1 release)

 

 - 2002/02/20 FIXED  Converted all makefiles and internal build logic to use make
                     nmake is gone for good.

 - 2002/02/23 FIXED  Fixed sprite 0 bug, now all 128 sprites can be used. 

 - 2002/02/25 FIXED  Fixed a few installer glitches

 - 2002/02/25 FIXED  Made this complete distribution GPL compliant

 - 2002/02/25 CHANGE Changed HAM license, HAM is now freeware for ALL uses

 - 2002/02/25 ADDED  Added freeware notice

 - 2002/02/25 ADDED  Added some sprite modification functions

 - 2002/02/25 ADDED  Added help pages for the sprite functions, and fixed some help pages

 

 -  2002/02/26 -----  Released HAM v2.1

 

 - 2002/03/02 FIXED  Fixed a really nasty HAMlib Map fragment bug that used to choke
                     when the fragment rectangle was smaller than the fragment. Thx to
                     Adalbert for the tip.

 - 2002/03/02 FIXED  Another really nasty one fixed, this time in ham_InitTileSet. You
                     can now init TileSets bigger than 16kb, if there is memory left
                     for them (64kb maximum)

 - 2002/03/03 FIXED  Due to the fix before, I noticed the DMA used in ham_InitTileSet
                     could only transfer max 0x8000 bytes. Fixed to 0x10000, which will
                     do for all tile Loads.

 - 2002/03/03 CHANGE Changed number of parameters of ham_InitTileSet to allow auto aligning
                     of a TileSet to a CBB boundary. See the HAMlib reference for more info.

 - 2002/03/04 FIXED  Fixed even one more nasty bug... the OAM system always forgot about
                     the last sprite in your sprite chain... lame one, sorry. Now works. Thx
                     to Andrea Beretta for the heads up.

 

 -  2002/03/06 -----  Released HAM registered beta 2.15

 

 - 2002/03/07 FIXED  Made various memory access macros more safe (parenth. fixes)

 - 2002/03/07 ADDED  Added two new sprite functions: ham_SetObjVisible and the much
                     requested ham_UpdateObjGfx, which allows to DMA new gfx into
                     a HAMlib sprite.

 - 2002/03/07 ADDED  Added a new field (non intrusive to existing code) into the
                     ham_obj structure called "active". If you set this to 0, your
                      sprite is not copied into OAM, and therefore is not visible.
                     setting back to 1 re-enables the sprite.

 - 2002/03/07 ADDED  Added a new sample source that shows how to do animated sprites.

 - 2002/03/07 ADDED  Added another new sample source showing big map scrolling

 - 2002/03/07 FIXED  Fixed the sprite positions to off screen as default to prevent
                     sprites obscuring block 0 on the display. All sprites now
                      init during system setup to 241,241. Also, during operation,
                     an unused OAM entry now defaults to these coordinates.

 

 -  2002/03/08 -----  Released HAM 2.15 final

 

 - 2002/03/10 FIXED  Fixed a really stupid bug in ham_UpdateObjGfx. It did not work with
                     all the different sprite sizes. Now it should. Thanks to jillgof
                     and fed_tts for letting me know.

 - 2002/03/10 ADDED  Added range checking for ham_SetObjX / Y , so that passed u16's can
                     no more garble the sprite data if too big.

 

 -  2002/03/10 -----  Released HAMlib 2.16 registered bugfix version
 -  2002/03/11 -----  Released HAMlib 2.16 bugfix version

 

 - 2002/03/11 ADDED  Added full set of DMA3 defines, including tool defines for DMA3
                     DMA is now 100% implemented, finally. 

 - 2002/03/15 ADDED  Added a more meaningful target for people that want to use the
                     MBV2 to flash their Carts, and then debug using MBV2 console. The
                     make flambv2 target now creates the ROM, fixes the header, sends
                     it, and then opens the MBV2 debug console.

 - 2002/03/15 FIXED  ...well not really fixed, but i enlarged the Stack frame a bit, it
                     is now 100 bytes larger. Some apps tended to flood the user stack
                     because the interrupt stack was too small. Thanks to fed_tts 

 - 2002/03/15 FIXED  Removed a few unnecessary globals. HAMlib RAM footprint down
                      another 100 bytes.

 - 2002/03/15 FIXED  Refined ham_CreateObj error checking. Now detects correctly
                     if prohibited obj_shape is passed.

 - 2002/03/15 FIXED  Fixed a bad bug in the VRAM manager. The problem was that you
                      could not reserve space for a single tile only. Fixed and verified.
                     Thanks to Goffredo for the hint.

 - 2002/03/15 ADDED  Added a power rotation / scaling function with great control over
                     all zooming/scrolling parameters called ham_RotBgEx

 - 2002/03/16 ADDED  Added two new example sources, one with 2 layer BG rotation, and
                     one showing how to use ham_RotBgEx. IMHO the most clear example
                     on rotation/scaling ever ;) I finally understand it now hehe

 - 2002/03/16 FIXED  fixed bug in ham_InitBg documentation. Thx to hamdev@ for the hint.

 - 2002/03/18 ADDED  Finally, introduced Sprite rotation service functions, along with
                     another new code sample named objrot ... see the source and the
                      ham_RotObj* functions for more information.

 - 2002/03/18 FIXED  Fixed a little bug in ham_CopyObjToOAM, now it only resets the
                     actual unused sprites to an offscreen location, rather than every
                     rotation set and so on.

 - 2002/03/18 ADDED  INTERNAL: Added a automatic testsuite to catch HAMlib bugs easier.

 - 2002/03/18 ADDED  Added documentation for all this new crap.

 

 -  2002/03/18 -----  Released HAM 2.18 registered

 -  2002/03/19 -----  Released HAM 2.18 freeware

 

 - 2002/03/18 FIXED  ARGH, wish I would have noticed this one earlier. ham_DeInitMap
                     and Tile actually tried to deallocate OBJ RAM :( now fixed.

 

 -  2002/03/19 -----  Released HAMlib 2.18a

 

 - 2002/03/19 FIXED  ham_DeleteObj could not delete Obj nr 0 once created. Fixed.

 - 2002/03/25 WIP Began working on sound support code in HAMlib. Do NOT use the
                      sound functions in HAMlib yet, as they will NOT work until further
                      notice.

 - 2002/03/25 CHANGE renamed the SNDCNT2 register and macros to SNDCNT3, since i
                      need to make room for the real SNDCNT2 (0x82), SNDCNT3 is at 0x84

 - 2002/03/25 ADDED  Added the new Directsound control macros M_SNDCNT2*, thanks a ton to
                     Belogic.com's excellent reference!

 - 2002/03/25 ADDED  Added new DMA1/2 timing DMA_STARTAT_SOUND_FIFO

 - 2002/03/25 ADDED  Added register declarations for Direct Sound FIFO buffers R_SNDFIFO*

 - 2002/03/25 ADDED  Added more powerful DMA TOOL_ defines that allow repeat and
                      in/decrement controls. 

 - 2002/03/20 FIXED  Memory deallocation of cloned objects was wrong, it actually did not
                     allow to deallocate a clone because the memory of the original is already
                     freed. Fixed in memory manager by just exiting if this is found.

 - 2002/04/06 ADDED  New function! ham_GetMapTile has been introduced. See the docs for
                      further information.

 - 2002/04/06 FIXED  The last two GFX functions that were still using DMA1 for data transfer
                     now (correctly) use DMA3, ham_UpdateObjGfx and the palette loading
                     functions. This way, they will not interfere with sound FIFO operations.

 - 2002/04/07 ADDED  Added F_DISCNT_BUFSEL_GET and a few other macros there.

 - 2002/04/07 ADDED  Added Eloists GBA.h header defines, for the ones that like them
                     better than HAMs (i do, however think you should use the HAM scheme
                     since it is more than a list of registers, this is just to make
                      porting of devkitadvance sources easier.) Included into mygba.h

 - 2002/04/07 FIXED  Fixed a performance problem in the core, results in a nice speedup
                     when using the registered release version. Another reason to register ;)
                     Only the NON-Asserting version of HAMlib got faster.

 - 2002/04/08 FIXED  Fixed 8*16 and 16*8 sprite bug, only half the sprite was loaded with
                     ham_CreateObj

 - 2002/04/08 WIP Added, on public request a bitmap mode PlotPixel and PlotLine function.
                     Works in all Bitmap modes (3,4,5) . See the documentation for details.

 - 2002/04/08 WIP Added Sprite sorting function called ham_SetObjBefore. Pretty
                      early, but they should work.
                     Let me know if you have any problems.

 - 2002/04/12 ADDED  Added / changed a lot of documentation to better help users.

 - 2002/04/12 WIP Added new troubleshooting section to this document.

 - 2002/04/12 FIXED  Fixed memory address entry in debugger to accept input with less
                     than 8 numbers. Also unified input routines for less space, more
                      reliability. Really, if you don't have a MBV2, you need one now
                     to use this feature, it rocks.

 - 2002/04/13 FIXED  Fixed obj reference count display in debugger object memory viewer.

 - 2002/04/13 ADDED  Added TOOL_INT_DISABLE_START and END macros. With these you can
                      flag an area of code to never be interrupted, even if interrupts
                      are scheduled. Automatically recovers existing interrupts after
                      flagged section. See mygba.h for details.

 - 2002/04/14 ADDED  Added a switch that allows to invoke the debugger (MBV2 dbg_Show)
                      instead of showing the ASSERTion screen. Just set
                     _hamlib_assert_to_dbgshow=1; after ham_Init() . This allows to
                      have a look at the memory and other stuff when your code fails,
                     instead of just halting the GBA.

 

 -  2002/04/15 -----  Released HAM v2.20

 

 - 2002/04/17 FIXED  Fixed wrong addresses of R_TIM1CNT and R_TIM2CNT. Thanks Adalbert!

 - 2002/04/17 FIXED  Fixed all the shitty double escaped backslashes to the much cleaner
                     forward slashing, using /cygdrive/

 - 2002/04/17 FIXED  The fix before here also resolved the long wait time some people
                     experienced before the compiler could kick off. You will need to replace
                     the backslashes in your makefiles to forward slashes.

 - 2002/04/17 ADDED  Updated VisualBoyAdvance to 0.9a SDL

 - 2002/04/17 ADDED  Added an autoreset to the flambv2 target, saves you some seconds...

 - 2002/04/17 FIXED  Fixed a OBJ memory manager bug that only happened in the debug version
                     of HAMlib. Thanks to Adalbert for catching it!

 - 2002/04/17 ADDED  Some of the crashbug reports were not really crash bugs, but I forgot
                     to mention that you now have to enable multiple interrupts in crt0.s
                     However, I now changed the standard crt0.s makefile target to take
                      a single, common crt0.s for all projects. If you REALLY need to touch
                     this, you ll have to create a different target. It will be much more
                      user friendly that way i guess.

 - 2002/04/17 FIXED  Finally, I think the crash bug is found. It happened when you deleted
                     all OBJs and then used ham_CopyObjToOAM. Please let me know if you
                     still have problems.

 - 2002/04/18 FIXED  Several fixes to the fault tolerance/stability of ham_SetObjBefore 

 - 2002/04/18 ADDED  MAJOR: Added a complete working Source level debugger, GDB to HAM

 - 2002/04/18 ADDED  Added some troubleshooting items for the new features.

 

 -  2002/04/18 -----  Released HAM 2.30

 

 - 2002/04/30 FIXED  Fixed the Installation Troubles Help section to comply with 2.30

 - 2002/05/12 ADDED  Added a note how to fix the "badly punctuated parameter list" bug.

 - 2002/05/12 ADDED  Upgraded the complete HAM toolchain to GCC 3.0.4 / Newlib 1.10.

 - 2002/05/12 ADDED  Added proper interworking support to HAM libs. Actually, going to
                     gcc-arm/lib, it is now up to you which libs you want. ARM, Thumb,
                     and interwork are available, just copy them into gcc-arm/lib.

 - 2002/05/12 ADDED  Full C++ support with the new compiler suite. Just name your source
                     file as ".cpp" and you will be able to compile C++ source code!

 - 2002/05/12 ADDED  As a side effect of this, your AgbMain functions have to be renamed
                     to main.

 - 2002/05/12 ADDED  C++ standard libraries have been added and can be included. They are
                     NOT changed by me for GBA, so some of them are useless.

 - 2002/05/12 FIXED  The Text system font was, dumbass me, loaded into IWRAM. Now it
                      stays in ROM, and saves 3k of precious IWRAM.

 - 2002/05/17 FIXED  Fixed a glitch in the DMA_STARTAT defines, modes 2 and 3 were broken.

 - 2002/05/19 ADDED  Added a new parameter to ham_CreateObj called dbl_size and updated
                     the relevant documentation.

 - 2002/05/19 FIXED  Improved GDB makefile target. More in line with Linux ports, faster,
                     less hacks. Users should not note a difference besides invokation
                     speed increases.

 - 2002/05/19 ADDED  Upgraded kit to VBA 0.9.1 and gfx2gba 0.10 final

 - 2002/05/29 FIXED  ham_CreateObj DMAed double the RAM needed for OBJs. Thanks hamdev@ !

 - 2002/05/29 ADDED  Added 16col Palette selection parameter to ham_CreateObj

 - 2002/05/30 ADDED  Added automatic ROM header correction to standard targets.

 - 2002/05/30 ADDED  Added 16col OBJ support to HAM OBJ memory manager

 - 2002/05/30 ADDED  Added new hamlib function ham_LoadBGPal16 and ham_LoadObjPal16 for
                      loading 16 colore palettes into memory

 - 2002/05/30 ADDED  Fixed the ham_UpdateObjGfx function to a) be faster and use 32 bit
                      DMA, and also to be 16color support aware, depending on the
                      sprites settings.

 - 2002/05/31 FIXED  DISSTAT_VCNT_SET and GET macros had a nasty shifting bug. Thanks to
                     Adrian Jackson for letting me know

 

 - 2002/06/03 FIXED  Fixed the compiler setup to always generate O1 optimized code, it
                      works best in terms of speed with HAMlib.

 - 2002/06/05 ADDED  Final HAMlib Direct Sound framework done, function list finalised

 - 2002/06/07 ADDED  Improved the mixer to accept any bitrate, as well as play any sample
                     rate and stretch.

 - 2002/06/08 FIXED  Some cleanups in the startup code of HAMlib

 - 2002/06/11 FIXED  QAed most new functionality except 16 color mode. Fixes across the
                      board. Looks stable

 - 2002/06/11 ADDED  Added new Makefile targets that will convert a .WAV file into an
                     .o file that is getting linked just by adding it to the list of
                     objects to be compiled in the Makefile.

 - 2002/06/12 ADDED  Added documentation for all the new stuff

 - 2002/09/09 ----- Released HAM 2.5


 - 2002/09/15 ADDED  Working Krawall support. Included tools and freeware libs into HAM makefile targets

 - 2002/09/20 ADDED  Added support for both free and registered Krawall tool chains

 - 2002/10/15 ADDED  Completely rewrote HAM documentation, now 100% function coverage

 - 2002/10/23 FIXED  Speeded up ham_PutPixel() by 100%

 - 2002/10/28 FIXED  Fixed a Linked list problem for OBJ in ham_SetObjBefore() that 
                     occured when moving the first list element multiple times.

 - 2002/10/30 FIXED  Fixed a bug in the runme compiler builder edition that incorrectly 
                     converted a DOS path to the corresponding GCC UNIX compilation path.

 - 2002/10/30 FIXED  Converted a few functions to use DMA3 instead of DMA0. All HAMlib DMA use
                     should now only need DMA3.

 - 2002/11/05 ADDED  Improved Krawall build logic, displaying additional information for user.

 - 2002/11/05 FIXED  Fixed a rotation system bug, which caused the subsystem to consume 2k of IWRAM.

                     together with Peter Schraut of VHAM fame.

 - 2002/12/15 ADDED  Added several new Palette and Obj Functions
 
 - 2002/12/15 FIXED  Fixed a few setup scripts to avoid GDB debugger to behave weird when stepping
                     through code. If a debugger version of your GBA ROM are built, they are now
                     using GCC optimization level 0, if not, its Level 2.

 - 2002/12/20 ADDED  Added HAM BG/OBJ FX control functions

 - 2002/12/22 ADDED  Added BG and OBJ reset functions.
 
 - 2002/12/22 FIXED  Fixed the performance of several OBJ related functions. The overall OBJ system
                     should be quite a bit faster. ham_CopyObjToOAM speeded up 50%. Again contributions
                     by Peter Schraut, thanks!

<h1><a name="ham-doxygen">Introducing the new HAMdoc</a>
</h1><dl compact><dt><b>I really liked the old HAMdoc format! Why did you change it?</b></dt><dd>
Simple. The old documentation was a completely separate piece of information that had to be updated completely separate from the code changes. It was therefore very hard to keep the documentation 100% in sync with changes in HAM. As HAM is growing rapidly whereas my time is not, I had to change the way documentation is created and kept up to date. I looked around for free tools on this for a while, and finally selected Doxygen ( <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">http://www.doxygen.org</a> ).</dl><dl compact><dt><b>What has changed?</b></dt><dd>
Doxygen directly uses the HAMlib source code as the input to create the new documentation. This has several key advantages:<ul>
<li>all function names and parameter formats are always 100% correctly documented <li>100% function coverage in the docs. You will note several functions that you never heard of before, simply because I forgot to document them.<li>update proof: When I change code in HAMlib, it is directly reflected in the documentation, even if there is no extra documentation set up, the new/changed functions will show up.</ul>
</dl>Also, Doxygen is very flexible in its output: This documentation is available in HTML,PDF and Windows HELP format, and could also be exported as a man page amongst many other possible formats.<dl compact><dt><b>Isn't this just a reformatted version of what we already have?</b></dt><dd>
Not really. First, read the above, that is a core difference. Second, there are many new documenation entries. Third, the FAQ has been completely rewritten amongst other sections. It was a lot of work to do intiially, but I am very happy with the result now. I hope you will be , too.</dl><dl compact><dt><b>But I don't like the fonts :-(</b></dt><dd>
Sorry about them. But I think the overall documentation is a <b>lot</b> better now.</dl>  <br clear=all><hr>

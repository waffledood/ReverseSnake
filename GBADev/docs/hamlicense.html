Note that HAMlib, the function library that resides at gcc-arm/lib/libham.a, is <b>NOT</b> covered by the GPL. The HAMlib is only provided in binary form, but is FREE for ALL uses (meaning any distribution/linking of the library provided with the package), as long as the library binary is not changed in any way, and this copyright notice is preserved when redistributing this library. This  classifies HAMlib as "Freeware", but not "free software" as outlined in the GPL.</dl><dl compact><dt><b>HAMlib registration</b></dt><dd>
In this free version of HAMlib, you will notice there is a forced intro screen. If you do not want this screen to appear, you will have to register HAMlib. This will also give you some more features, like a version of the library that works slightly faster by providing means to disable ASSERTions. There are two registration options for HAMlib:<ul>
<li>version in binary only, that has no intro screen and possibility to run without ASSERTion overhead. (other bonuses available, online ordering via CC)<li>version with full source code and build instructions (please email me for this) <br>
  Detailed instructions on how to get registered and pricing are found on this page: <a href="http://www.ngine.de/ham-reg.html">http://www.ngine.de/ham-reg.html</a></ul>

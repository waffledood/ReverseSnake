<h1><a name="targets">Standard Makefile Targets</a>
</h1>
<p>
For all programs written using a standard HAM makefile, HAM comes with a few standard targets (or less confusing: commands you can execute to tell HAM what to do with your source code) that seem generic enough so you might also want to use them in your application.<dl compact><dt><b>What is a Makefile target?</b></dt><dd>
For those who do not know, a Makefile target is basically a command following the make command, that will alter the creation and compilation process of the software. No worries though, I made it really easy for you to run... just go to the <em>obj</em> sample and try it out!</dl><dl compact><dt><b>List of HAM standard makefile targets</b></dt><dd>
These Makefile targets are automatically available in your project if you use the makefile  template from one of the samples.</dl><div class="fragment"><pre>

 - make vba 
   All the code is recompiled, the GBA ROM is created and then HAMs integrated VisualboyAdvance 
   will open and play the ROM 

 - make mbv2 
   All the code is recompiled, the GBA ROM is created and then the ROM is sent to a real GBA 
   using an MBV2 cable. Note this can only work if the code is smaller than 256kb. 

 - make emu
   makes your GBA ROM, then sends it off to the emu you configured in the installation routine. 
   Defaults to VisualBoyAdvance 

 - make fla
   makes your GBA ROM, then sends it to a Visoly FlashAdvance cart using Jeffs sending tool. 
   Make sure your cart is plugged into the linker and the linker is turned on
 
 - make flambv2
   for the people that have both a FLA cart and a MBV2 this is a pretty cool option. Makes the 
   GBA ROM and then sends it onto a FLA cart which must be in your GBA over the MBV2 cable. 
   Really convienient...
 
 - make gdb
   Enter the Source Level debugger for your project. Also see this page for further information
 
</pre></div>
<p>
If you need more information on the HAM makefiles, I suppose you will need to learn how they work, but here is one hint:
<p>
HAM shares a common makefile, that should never need changing from your end as long as you are not going to tinker with compiler options. The common Makefile is included in all the sample Makefiles, and what is defined in there is mandatory to most HAM programs you are going to compile, so it is best not to touch it too much.
<p>
It can be found here: system/master.mak
<p>
It is pretty well documented, so you might want to take a look at it.

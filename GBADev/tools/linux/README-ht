Header Tool v0.01 ---- (c) 02 buZz
Contact : buzz@ddsw.nl

 history :

 I've build this tool cause there where no easy to work with tools for GBA
 header manipulation that i could use while running linux.

 requirements :

 perl5 or higher (build using perl 5.6.1)
 Getopt::Std module (www.cpan.org if not allready installed)
 Some GBA roms

 usage :

 ht.pl [-cl] [-n "ROMNAME"] [-o FILENAME] <FILENAME>

  <FILENAME>      The .gba romfile you want to use
  [-o FILENAME]   Fix errors and save rom as FILENAME
  [-n "ROMNAME"]  Change name to ROMNAME (12 chars max)
  [-c]            Check complement check
  [-l]            Check logo

 examples :

  ht.pl -cl thisrom.gba
   Checks logo and complement check in thisrom.gba and prints
   the found results

  ht.pl -cl -o newrom.gba thisrom.gba
   Checks logo and complement check in thisrom.gba and saves a fixed
   version as newrom.gba

  ht.pl -n "My game" -o newrom.gba thisrom.gba
   Changes the name in the header of thisrom.gba from the current
   name into My game and saves the result as the new rom newrom.gba

  caution :

  If you change the name inside a GBA rom , you really need to fix the
  checksum aswell , else it will not be functional.


Hope you enjoy this!
